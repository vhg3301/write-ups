# Basic Pentest Machine - TryHackMe

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Vitor, a beginner in the cybersecurity world. I love this area and I'm trying my best with TryHackMe CTFs. This is my writeup about the Basic Pentest challenge - my very first machine!

## Initial Reconnaissance

As a beginner, I really don't know much about what to do with a target. I started with reconnaissance using nmap, which I was already familiar with. 
I opened my Kali Linux virtual machine and typed:

```bash
nmap -sV -sC -Pn -sS [IP address]
```

The scan revealed several open ports:
- **22** â†’ SSH
- **80** â†’ HTTP  
- **139** â†’ NetBIOS
- **445** â†’ SMB
- **8009** â†’ Apache Tomcat
- **8080** â†’ Alternative web server

## Following the Walkthrough

After seeing these results, I gave up trying by myself because I don't know much about the tools available and what to use in each situation. 
So I went to YouTube, searched for "basic pentest writeup", clicked on the HackHund video, and followed it step by step. 
HackHund helped me understand the CTF process and introduced me to new tools.

### Web Enumeration

Following the walkthrough, I first explored the website and clicked "view page source", where I found the phrase: 
*"Check our dev note section if you need to know what to work on."*

Since the main website didn't have much information, I used directory enumeration:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://[IP address] -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

This revealed the `/development` directory. Inside, I found a `dev.txt` file containing a conversation between developers K and J, 
mentioning that password hashes were stored in `/etc/shadow`.

### SMB Enumeration

Next, I enumerated SMB users:

```bash
enum4linux -S [IP address]
```

This revealed an "anonymous" user. I connected without a password and found a `staff.txt` file, which contained information about a user named "Jan" having a weak password.

### Password Attack

Using this information, I performed a brute force attack:

```bash
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh:[IP address] -V
```

Hydra found the password "armando". I then connected via SSH and explored the system.

### Privilege Escalation

As user Jan, I discovered another user "Kay" but couldn't access their files. However, I found SSH keys in Jan's `.ssh` directory.
I copied the private key (`id_rsa`) and used John the Ripper to crack it:

```bash
ssh2john id_rsa > hash.txt
john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

This revealed the passphrase "beeswax", which allowed me to complete the challenge.

## What I Learned

### Tool Importance

**Nmap** is crucial because without it, you're like a blind person in a war - you don't know what to target, which ports are open, or what services are running. 
It's your first step to understand the attack surface.

**Gobuster** is equally important for web applications. You need to know where to look and what directories exist. 
Hidden directories often contain sensitive information that's not linked from the main page.

**Hydra** might seem obvious, but it's vital for finding the right passwords. In modern systems, you often have limited login attempts (maybe only 3 tries), 
so having an efficient brute force tool is essential.

### New Concepts

This was my first exposure to **SMB enumeration** and **SSH key cracking**. 
While I followed the steps, I still need to understand these tools better - how they work, why we use them, and their importance in the penetration testing process.

## Challenges Faced

- **Tool familiarity**: Not knowing which tools to use for each situation
- **Process flow**: Understanding the logical sequence of a penetration test
- **Documentation**: I didn't save outputs or flags (lesson learned for next time!)

## Final Thoughts

I loved doing my first CTF! TryHackMe taught me so much in a short time, and I've already fallen in love with this field. 
While I followed a walkthrough, I learned the methodology and got hands-on experience with essential tools.

Next time, I'll try to solve more on my own and document everything better. This is just the beginning of my cybersecurity journey!

See you in the next writeup! ðŸš€
